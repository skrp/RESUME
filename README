# PERSONALITY #####################################################################
I am eccentric in a poetic way of harrowing adventure.

I nurture a love of numbers & system implementations.
My emloyers & world-class-coworkers have respect for my work

Numbers-perfection is the pursuit.
An imbalance is a curious mystery that I solve with the zealous of Sherlock Holmes.

I am odd, but every company I've worked for - I've saved from catastrophes.
The weight of resposibilty is the hammer of my actions.

Investing in my services will always pay dividends.
Work performed is documented for permanent improvement.
